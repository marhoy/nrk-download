Downloading programs
--------------------

For downloading a specific program that is not part of a series, the URL
could look like e.g. https://tv.nrk.no/program/MUHH49000021


Dowloading series
-----------------

Let's say you are interested in downloading all the available episodes about the rescue
boat "Elias". You would then search for "Elias" on https://tv.nrk.no and end up at a
page with the URL https://tv.nrk.no/serie/elias. If you give this URL as an argument to
``nrkdownload``, all (available) episodes in all seasons will be downloaded.


Downloading a single season
---------------------------

If you are only interested in a specific season of a series, click around on
the webpages until you are only looking at that season. As an example, if you
wanted to download the third season of SKAM, you would use an URL like
https://tv.nrk.no/serie/skam/sesong/3


Downloading a single episode
----------------------------

If you want to download only a single episode of a series, navigate https://tv.nrk.no
until that episode is selected. The URL will look like e.g.
https://tv.nrk.no/serie/kongen-av-gulset/sesong/1/episode/MYNT19000318 or
https://tv.nrk.no/serie/klassequizen/sesong/2021/episode/DSRR21000521, where information
about the episode is included.

Giving a URL like this as argument to nrkdownload, will result in only this single
episode to be downloaded.

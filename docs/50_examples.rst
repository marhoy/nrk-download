Dowloading series
-----------------

Let's say you are interested in downloading all the available episodes about the rescue
boat "Elias". You would then search for "Elias" on https://tv.nrk.no and end up at a
page with the URL https://tv.nrk.no/serie/elias. If you give this URL as an argument to
``nrkdownload``, all (available) episodes in all seasons will be downloaded.


Downloading seasons
-------------------

If you are only interested in a specific season of a series, click around on
the webpages until you are only looking at that season. As an example, if you
wanted to download the third season of SKAM, you would use an URL like
https://tv.nrk.no/serie/skam/sesong/3


Downloading programs
--------------------

For downloading a specific program that is not part of a series, the URL
could look like e.g. https://tv.nrk.no/program/KOID28004110/pushwagner

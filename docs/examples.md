# Examples

## Downloading a program

For downloading a specific program that is not part of a series, the URL could look like
e.g. <https://tv.nrk.no/program/MUHH49000021>. Giving this URL as an argument would
download the program.

## Dowloading a whole series

Let's say you are interested in downloading all the available episodes about the rescue
boat "Elias". You would then search for "Elias" on https://tv.nrk.no and end up at a
page with the URL <https://tv.nrk.no/serie/elias>. If you give this URL as an argument
to `nrkdownload`, all (available) episodes in all seasons will be downloaded.

## Downloading a single season from a series

If you are only interested in a specific season of a series, click around on the
webpages until you are only looking at that season. As an example, if you wanted to
download the third season of SKAM, you would use an URL like
<https://tv.nrk.no/serie/skam/sesong/3>.

## Downloading a single episode from a series

If you want to download only a single episode of a series, navigate https://tv.nrk.no
until that episode is selected. The URL will look like e.g.
<https://tv.nrk.no/serie/kongen-av-gulset/sesong/1/episode/MYNT19000318> or
<https://tv.nrk.no/serie/klassequizen/sesong/2021/episode/DSRR21000521>, where
information about the episode is included.

Giving a URL like this as argument to nrkdownload, will result in only this single
episode to be downloaded.

## Downloading extra content

If you are interested in downloading extra content, like trailers, etc., just browse to
the content and copy the URL, e.g.
<https://tv.nrk.no/serie/monsen-og-nasjonalparkene/sesong/ekstramateriale/episode/MUHU02600025>.
This example would download more than 4 hours of watching a campfire.
